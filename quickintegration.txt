Quick integration notes for backend devs

POST /api/analyze accepts multipart/form-data with field image and returns JSON:

{
  "id":"abc123",
  "timestamp":"2025-09-30T08:30:00Z",
  "shrimpCount": 5000,
  "biomass": "7.5 g",
  "feedRecommendation": "11.25 g/day",
  "protein_g": 6.19,
  "filler_g": 5.06,
  "imageUrl": "https://.../uploaded.jpg"
}


The front-end adapter will normalize fields to the shape used in the UI.

GET /api/history returns an array of the same objects above. The frontend will adapt each item.

The analyzeImage() function emits an analysis:complete event after successfully receiving the backend response so any listening page (Results, History) gets updated immediately.
